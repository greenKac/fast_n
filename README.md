*Fast_n* is a fast and easy to use python library to generate noise. **It currently only supports perlin noise.**

## Installation

Type ``pip install fast_n`` in your command prompt to install *fast_n*. If you do not have python installed, download it on the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Use cases

Noise is very useful for anything procedural, being especially used for procedural world generation in video games. *Fast_n* is fast enough for most use cases.

## Features

At the moment, only perlin noise is implemented but I'm sure I'll add more at some point, and I already plan on improving the speed of the noise generation by writing it in C rather than pure python.
